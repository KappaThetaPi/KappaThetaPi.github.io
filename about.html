		<p class="desc">Kappa Theta Pi is a professional fraternity dedicated towards developing a passion and love for technology. KTP focuses mostly on CSSE and ECE majors, though we do accept all majors. The Rose-Hulman chapter was just started in 2016, and are still growing. Join us winter quarter for rush and learn more about this fantastic brotherhood experience!</p>

		<p class="desc">Even though KTP is a fraternity, you can still join a social fraternity at the same time. However, KTP still has a very active social side and brotherhood.</p>
